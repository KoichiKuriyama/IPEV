# IPEV Model

The integer programing extreme value (IPEV) model  accounts the integer property of trip data and has the same advantages as the multiple discreteâ€“continuous extreme value choice (MDCEV) model. IPEV model is consistent with utility theory and provides a single structural framework for simultaneously modeling the choice of alternatives and quantity decisions with the constraint of the integer value of consumption. This model has a closed-form probability expression. This  code includes the estimation using closed-form or simulation, the demand prediction, the welfare analysis, and the sample dataset.
